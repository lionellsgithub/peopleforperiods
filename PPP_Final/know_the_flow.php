<p>It’s one of the most natural things in the world and a huge aspect of women’s health, yet there’s so much we don’t know about periods. Women menstruate monthly for about 40 years—close to 500 times in a lifetime—yet the topic’s enduring taboo status leaves most of us medically and socially in the dark. Without any real education, we’re left with false assumptions, gross misunderstandings, and comically ridiculous guesses that do our women and our culture a disservice. It’s time we take this taboo off the shelf and proudly walk it to the register.

	Print advertising may have featured sanitary products since the roaring ’20s, but on-air advertising wasn’t allowed until 1972. And it was more than a decade before America’s trailblazing Friend, Courteney Cox, became the first woman to say the word in a Tampax commercial. Now, that’s progress.

	When Ride let her NASA engineers know that 100 wasn’t exactly the right number of tampons necessary for the trip, they responded, “Well, we want to be safe.” (For the record, the average woman uses about 20 tampons during her 3–5-day-long period.)

	Is that a red spot on your dress, Minnie? In 1946, Walt Disney Productions teamed up with Kotex to create an educational cartoon shown to girls throughout U.S. schools well into the late ‘60s. More a sign of the times and less progressively minded than today’s educators might prefer, the film filled with vapidly helpful tips like putting on makeup and keeping “well-groomed” is now preserved in the National Film Registry.

	How much money does the state of California make from pad and tampon sales in a year?

	<img class="topline" src="images/section3/topline.png"/><br/>
	As in most of the U.S., feminine hygiene products in California are subject to a state sales tax.  Many opponents argue that tampons and pads should be exempt from taxation and treated as a basic health necessity—like some states do with Viagra, despite still maintaining the controversial “tampon tax.”

	Which country started mandating “menstrual leave” in the 1940s?
	</p>
	<p class="words2">
	<span>Japan</span><br/>
	<img class="topline" src="images/section3/topline.png"/><br/>
	Japan, it turns out, was way ahead of our fourth-period gym class. As record numbers of women entered the nation’s post-WWII workforce, the country passed a law granting serikyuuka (physiological leave) for women suffering from painful cramps. Today’s high schoolers may still be trying to convince their coaches it’s a legit excuse—but for up to 20% of women, cramp pain can be so severe that it completely impedes daily activities. Ouch!

<h1>How’d you do?</h1>
<br/><br/>
<p>The truth is, these questions don’t come close to covering all there is to know about menstruation around the world. A lot goes unknown about women’s education and access to the sanitary products they need around the world. If you’re interested in learning more about access, education and affordability as it relates to women’s menstrual health around the world, advance to Part III of our site, “Bleeding for Equality”.
